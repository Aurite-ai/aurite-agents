# Layer 2.5: Execution Layer

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-09

## 1. Overview

The Execution Layer acts as the runtime engine of the Aurite framework. It is responsible for taking user requests, instantiating the appropriate agentic components, and managing their execution from start to finish. This layer is orchestrated by the `ExecutionFacade`, which provides a clean, unified API for running agents and workflows.

This layer sits between the high-level Orchestration Layer (2), which manages configuration and lifecycle, and the low-level MCP Host Layer (3), which provides access to tools and resources.

Key responsibilities include:
*   Providing a single point of entry (`ExecutionFacade`) for all execution requests from the entrypoint layers (API, CLI, TUI).
*   Instantiating `Agent`, `SimpleWorkflowExecutor`, or `CustomWorkflowExecutor` based on the request.
*   Performing Just-in-Time (JIT) registration of MCP servers required by an agent.
*   Managing conversation history by interacting with the `StorageManager` or `CacheManager`.
*   Coordinating the multi-turn conversation loop within an `Agent`.
*   Executing linear sequences of agents in a `SimpleWorkflow`.
*   Dynamically loading and running user-defined Python code in a `CustomWorkflow`.

## 3. Core Components & Functionality

### 3.1. `ExecutionFacade`

The `ExecutionFacade` is the central hub of this layer. It receives requests from the `Aurite` class (Layer 2) and orchestrates the execution.

*   **Agent Execution (`run_agent`, `stream_agent_run`):**
    1.  Receives an agent name and user message.
    2.  Loads the `AgentConfig` using the `ConfigManager`.
    3.  **JIT Server Registration:** It inspects the `AgentConfig` for any required `mcp_servers`. If a server is not already active in the `MCPHost`, the facade loads its configuration and calls `MCPHost.register_client` to make it available for the current run.
    4.  **History Management:** If history is enabled, it loads the previous conversation messages from the `StorageManager` or `CacheManager`.
    5.  It instantiates the `Agent` class, passing the necessary configurations and manager instances (`MCPHost`, `StorageManager`, etc.).
    6.  It calls the agent's `run_conversation` or `stream_conversation` method to start the execution.
    7.  After the run completes, it ensures the final conversation history is saved.

*   **Workflow Execution (`run_simple_workflow`, `run_custom_workflow`):**
    1.  Receives a workflow name and initial input.
    2.  Loads the appropriate workflow configuration.
    3.  Instantiates the corresponding executor (`SimpleWorkflowExecutor` or `CustomWorkflowExecutor`).
    4.  Calls the executor's `execute` method, passing itself (`self`) as a handle so the workflow steps can in turn call back to the facade to run agents.

### 3.2. `Agent` and `AgentTurnProcessor`

The `Agent` class encapsulates the logic for a complete, stateful conversation.

*   **Initialization:** The `Agent` is created by the `ExecutionFacade` for a single end-to-end run. It receives its configuration, the `MCPHost` instance, and any initial messages (including history).
*   **Conversation Loop (`run_conversation`):**
    1.  The `Agent` enters a loop that continues until a final answer is generated or the turn limit is reached.
    2.  In each turn, it instantiates an `AgentTurnProcessor`.
    3.  **Tool Formatting:** Before calling the LLM, the `Agent` calls `MCPHost.get_formatted_tools` to get a list of tools available to it, respecting all filtering rules.
    4.  **LLM Call:** The `AgentTurnProcessor` is responsible for the actual call to the `LiteLLMClient`, sending the current message history and available tools.
    5.  **Response Processing:** The `AgentTurnProcessor` inspects the LLM's response.
        *   If it's a final answer, the loop terminates.
        *   If it contains `tool_calls`, the processor iterates through them.
    6.  **Tool Execution:** For each tool call, the `AgentTurnProcessor` calls `MCPHost.call_tool`. The `MCPHost` (Layer 3) handles the routing and execution, returning the result.
    7.  The tool results are formatted as a new message and appended to the conversation history for the next turn.
*   **Streaming (`stream_conversation`):** The streaming process follows a similar logic, but the `AgentTurnProcessor` yields events (`text_delta`, `tool_use_start`, `tool_result`, etc.) as they happen instead of waiting for the full turn to complete.

### 3.3. Workflow Executors

*   **`SimpleWorkflowExecutor`**:
    *   Executes a linear chain of agent interactions defined in a `simple_workflow` configuration.
    *   It iterates through the steps, using the output of one agent as the input for the next.
    *   Each step is executed by calling back to the `ExecutionFacade.run_agent` method.

*   **`CustomWorkflowExecutor`**:
    *   Provides a way to run arbitrary Python code as a workflow.
    *   It dynamically imports the class specified in the `custom_workflow` configuration's `module_path` and `class_name`.
    *   It calls the `execute_workflow` method on the instantiated class, passing the `ExecutionFacade` instance so the custom code can leverage the full power of the framework (running agents, accessing tools, etc.).
