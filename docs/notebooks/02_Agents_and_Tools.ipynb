    "# Aurite Agents Tutorial 2: Giving Agents Tools with MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second tutorial in the Aurite Agents series! In the previous tutorial, we learned how to create and configure a basic agent. Now, we'll explore one of the most powerful features of the framework: giving agents **Tools** to interact with the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Aurite, tools are provided by **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers**. These are external programs that can do anything from searching the web to analyzing data. By connecting an agent to an MCP Server, you give it access to all the tools that server provides (you can also exclude specific tools that you don't want agents to acess when you are adding new mcp server configurations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **What an MCP Server is** and how to configure one using a `ClientConfig` object.\n",
    "2.  How to connect to a tool server that runs on the web (using the `http_stream` transport), which is perfect for cloud environments like Google Colab.\n",
    "3.  How to use the library of **pre-packaged tools** that comes built-in with the `aurite` package."
