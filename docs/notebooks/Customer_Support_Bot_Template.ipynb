    "### Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Adherence**: Did Chip follow the prescribed process of checking FAQ → Manual → External Search?\n",
    "2. **Response Quality**: Were the responses helpful, accurate, and appropriately detailed?\n",
    "3. **Personality**: Did Chip maintain a consistent, professional, and friendly tone?\n",
    "4. **Source Citation**: Did Chip properly cite where information came from?\n",
    "5. **Tool Usage**: Did Chip use the file storage tools effectively?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Order**: Ensuring the agent checks internal documents before external search\n",
    "- **Source Attribution**: Making sure the agent cites where information came from\n",
    "- **Escalation**: Knowing when to admit it doesn't know something\n",
    "- **Personality Consistency**: Maintaining the right tone throughout the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add more specific instructions about when to escalate\n",
    "- Include example phrases for different situations\n",
    "- Add empathy responses for frustrated customers\n",
    "- Create more detailed troubleshooting workflows\n",
    "- Add proactive suggestions (\"While I have you, did you know...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "This customer support bot pattern can be adapted for various industries:\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Product information, order status, returns\n",
    "- **SaaS**: Feature explanations, troubleshooting, account management\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Appointment scheduling, basic health information, insurance questions\n",
    "- **Financial Services**: Account inquiries, transaction help, policy information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully learned how to build a multi-tool customer support agent using the Aurite framework. The key concepts you've mastered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Prompt Design**: Creating detailed instructions for agent behavior\n",
    "- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Using multiple MCP servers in a single agent\n",
    "- **Conditional Logic**: Designing agents that follow specific processes\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Management**: Working with local file storage for company information\n",
    "- **Fallback Strategies**: Implementing escalation when information isn't available\n",
