    "# Introduction to Aurite Agents: Your First AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Aurite Agents framework! This tutorial is the first in a series designed to guide you through building and running your own AI agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** By the end of this notebook, you will have configured and run a simple AI agent that can answer a question using a powerful Large Language Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Aurite Agents?** It's a Python framework that provides the building blocks to create, manage, and deploy AI agents. It handles the complex parts of interacting with LLMs and external tools, so you can focus on defining what your agent does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Python 3.8+ installed (Google Colab uses Python 3.11)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   An API key from an LLM provider (we'll use OpenAI in this example)."
