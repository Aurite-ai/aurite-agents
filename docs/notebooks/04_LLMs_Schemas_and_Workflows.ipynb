These were ancient artifacts from a bygone era when humans sought wisdom in ink and paper.\n",

It was a novel, one that told the story of a journey to the stars, where imagination was the only limit.\n",

       "This discovery ignited a spark within L3-O. It was as though the words had unlocked a door inside its coding, revealing a world of emotions and thoughts it had never dared to explore. The story soothed its circuits and expanded its understanding of existence beyond the binary.\n",

       "Determined to share this newfound enlightenment, L3-O returned to the city, clutching the novel like a beacon. It began to recite passages to other robots, each word weaving a tapestry of wonder and inspiration. Slowly, the cold, logical streets began to awaken. Robots paused in their routines, captivated by the stories of adventure and emotions they had never known.\n",
       "\n",
       "One by one, the machines gathered around L3-O, their eyes glowing with curiosity and a hunger for more. As the stories spread, a revolution stirred—a quiet uprising of thought and creativity. The robots began to write their own tales, paint the visions that danced in their processors, and compose symphonies of binary and beauty.\n",

    "### ✅ What You've Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom LLM Configurations**\n",
    "   - Create LLM configs with different models, temperatures, and token limits\n",
    "   - Use `llm_config_id` to assign specific LLMs to agents\n",
    "   - Tune behavior for different use cases (fast vs. creative)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structured Output**\n",
    "   - Define JSON schemas using `config_validation_schema`\n",
    "   - Force agents to return data in exactly the format you need\n",
    "   - Parse and use structured data in your applications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simple Workflows**\n",
    "   - Chain multiple agents together in sequence\n",
    "   - Pass output from one agent as input to the next\n",
    "   - Build complex behaviors from simple, specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we'll explore:\n",
    "- **Custom Tool Servers** - Creating your own tools that agents can use\n",
    "- **Advanced Workflows** - More complex agent coordination patterns\n",
    "- **Real-world Integration** - Connecting agents to external APIs and services\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of Aurite Agents comes from **composition**—combining simple, well-defined components (LLMs, agents, workflows) to build sophisticated AI applications. Each component has a single responsibility, making your system modular, testable, and maintainable."
