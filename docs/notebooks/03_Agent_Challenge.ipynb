    "# Optional Assignment: Agent Tooling Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "This **optional assignment** provides a hands-on opportunity to build agents that use a variety of powerful, pre-packaged tools. You will choose from the challenges below, each requiring you to configure and run a new agent to solve a specific problem using tools from the Aurite toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "*   Build confidence in using different tool servers from the built-in toolbox.\n",
    "*   Practice writing effective system prompts that guide an agent to select and use the correct tools.\n",
    "*   Gain experience with the end-to-end workflow of defining, registering, and running a tool-equipped agent."
