# Aurite Agents Framework - Learning Modules Overview

Welcome to the Aurite Agents Framework learning modules! This series will guide you through understanding, building, and deploying AI agents using Aurite.

## Step 1: Conceptual Understanding

**Purpose:** Before diving into hands-on coding, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts behind AI agents, their components (like system prompts and tools), and how they operate.

**Learning Path & Resources:**

*   **What is an AI Agent?**
    *   Please review the following resource from Hugging Face for a solid foundation.

## Step 2: Learning Aurite with Notebooks

**Purpose:** This module provides a hands-on, code-first approach to learning the Aurite Agents framework through a series of interactive Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

**Learning Path & Resources:**

1.  **Notebook 1: Introducing Aurite Agents**
    *   Get started with the basics of the framework.
    *   [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rCHTcVhdCUElChksmFt22PZR2E74OJQn?usp=sharing)

2.  **Notebook 2: Agents and Tools**
    *   Learn how to equip agents with tools to perform actions.

## Step 3: Building Local Projects

**Purpose:** Once you are comfortable with the concepts from the notebooks, these tutorials guide you through setting up and running the Aurite framework in a local development environment like VSCode.

**Learning Path & Resources:**

1.  **Understanding Aurite Projects**
    *   This tutorial walks you through the structure of a local Aurite project and how to configure and run an agent by editing configuration files.
    *   [[06_Understanding_Projects|Tutorial: Understanding Aurite Projects]]

2.  **Using the Aurite CLI**
    *   This tutorial teaches you how to execute any pre-configured agent directly from the command line, a powerful workflow for testing and automation.
