# Aurite Agents Framework - Learning Modules Overview

Welcome to the Aurite Agents Framework learning modules! This series will guide you through understanding, building, and deploying AI agents using Aurite.

## Step 1: Conceptual Understanding

**Purpose:** Before diving into hands-on coding, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts behind AI agents, their components (like system prompts and tools), and how they operate.

**Learning Path & Resources:**

*   **What is an AI Agent?**
    *   Please review the following resource from Hugging Face for a solid foundation.

## Step 2: Learning Aurite with Notebooks

**Purpose:** This module provides a hands-on, code-first approach to learning the Aurite Agents framework through a series of interactive Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

**Learning Path & Resources:**

1.  **Notebook 1: Introducing Aurite Agents**
    *   Get started with the basics of the framework.
    *   [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rCHTcVhdCUElChksmFt22PZR2E74OJQn?usp=sharing)

2.  **Notebook 2: Agents and Tools**
    *   Learn how to equip agents with tools to perform actions.

## Step 3: Building Projects in VSCode

**Purpose:** Once you are comfortable with the concepts from the notebooks, this tutorial guides you through setting up the Aurite framework locally and running your first AI agent by directly editing project files in a VSCode environment.

**Learning Path & Resources:**

1.  **Tutorial: Your First Agent via Configuration Files**
    *   This hands-on tutorial guides you through setting up the Aurite framework and configuring and running your first AI agent by directly editing project files.
