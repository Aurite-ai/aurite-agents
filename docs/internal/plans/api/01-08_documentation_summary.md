## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Revised Component Creation Approach
Based on team discussion, we completely revised how component creation works:
- No longer requires mandatory `file_path` parameter
- Implements intelligent file selection based on context
- Supports project/workspace specification
- Creates files automatically when needed

### 2. Created Comprehensive Documentation

#### Configuration Manager Routes Documentation
Created `docs/usage/routes/config_manager_routes.md` with:
- Complete component creation decision tree
- Detailed error handling reference for all endpoints
- Full API endpoint documentation
- Practical examples and best practices

#### Configuration Index Building Flow
Created `docs/architecture/config/index_building_flow.md` with:
- Three-phase index building process explanation
- Priority resolution logic (current context wins)
- ASCII flow diagrams and structured explanations
- Real-world examples showing how configs are loaded

### 3. Updated Existing Documentation
- **`docs/usage/api_reference.md`**: Added link to detailed config manager documentation
- **`docs/architecture/overview.md`**: Added reference to configuration system architecture
- **`.clinerules/documentation_guide.md`**: Added new documentation references

### 4. Key Design Decisions

#### Priority System
- **When in a project**: Project configs → Workspace configs → Other projects → User global
- **When in workspace**: Workspace configs → All projects → User global
- Current context always has highest priority

#### File Manager Architecture
Decided on a hybrid approach:
- Create `ConfigFileManager` as internal helper class
- Keep public API through `ConfigManager`
- Separates concerns while maintaining clean interface

## Next Steps

1. **Implement ConfigFileManager class** in `src/aurite/config/file_manager.py`
2. **Add file operation methods** to ConfigManager
3. **Implement file operation API routes**
4. **Update component creation logic** to follow the decision tree
5. **Update frontend client** with new methods and parameters
6. **Test the new priority system** with multiple projects

## Important Notes

- The current `_initialize_sources()` method needs modification to implement the new priority logic
- File paths must always be validated to prevent directory traversal
- Component creation response should include context information
- Error handling must follow the documented patterns
