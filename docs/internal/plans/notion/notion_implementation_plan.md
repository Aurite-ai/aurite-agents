This document provides a step-by-step plan for implementing the architecture defined in `docs/plans/notion_teamspace_architecture.md`. Each phase should be completed in order.

## Phase 1: Foundational Database Setup

The goal of this phase is to create the core database structures that will hold all teamspace information.

**Task 1.1: Create the `Home` Page** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Create a new, empty page in Notion named `üè† Home`.
*   **Details:** This will serve as the main entry point and future dashboard.

**Task 1.2: Create the `Master Initiatives` Database** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Inside the `Home` page, create a new full-page database named `‚ú® Master Initiatives`.
*   **Properties to Create:**
    *   `Name` (Title, default)
    *   `Type` (Select: "Framework", "Copilot", "Domain-Specific")
    *   `Status` (Select: "1Ô∏è‚É£ Planning", "2Ô∏è‚É£ In Progress", "3Ô∏è‚É£ Paused", "4Ô∏è‚É£ Complete")
    *   `Owner` (Person)
    *   `Timeline` (Date)

**Task 1.3: Create the `Framework Projects` Database** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Inside the `Home` page, create a new full-page database named `üî© Framework Projects`.
*   **Properties to Create:**
    *   `Name` (Title, default)
    *   `Sprint` (Text)
    *   `Epic` (Text)
    *   `Status` (Select: "Backlog", "Todo", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done")
    *   `Technical Lead` (Person)
    *   `Related PRs` (URL)

**Task 1.4: Create the `Copilot Projects` Database** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Inside the `Home` page, create a new full-page database named `ü§ñ Copilot Projects`.
*   **Properties to Create:**
    *   `Name` (Title, default)
    *   `Feature Area` (Select: "UI/UX", "Backend", "Agent Logic", "Integrations")
    *   `Target Persona` (Text)
    *   `Status` (Select: "Backlog", "Todo", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done")
    *   `UX/UI Status` (Select: "Mockup", "Prototype", "Implemented")

**Task 1.5: Create the `Domain-Specific Projects` Database** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Inside the `Home` page, create a new full-page database named `üìà Domain-Specific Projects`.
*   **Properties to Create:**
    *   `Name` (Title, default)
    *   `Client` (Text)
    *   `Status` (Select: "Lead", "Discovery", "In Progress", "On Hold", "Complete")

    *   `Name` (Title, default)
    *   `Category` (Select: "Meeting Notes", "Strategy", "Proposal", "Announcement", "Technical Spec")
    *   `Created Date` (Created Time)

---

## Phase 2: Establish Core Relations

This phase connects the foundational databases, creating the relational structure.

**Task 2.1: Link Master Initiatives to Specific Projects** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** In the `‚ú® Master Initiatives` DB, create a new property of type `Relation`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Name the property `Project Details`.
    *   Connect it to all three specific project databases: `Framework Projects`, `Copilot Projects`, and `Domain-Specific Projects`.
    *   Toggle "Show on" for each of the three databases to create the back-link.
    *   **Note:** This was adjusted during implementation to be three separate relation properties due to API limitations.

**Task 2.2: Link Document Hub to Master Initiatives** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** In the `üìö Document Hub` DB, create a new property of type `Relation`.
*   **Details:**
    *   Name the property `Related Initiative`.
    *   Connect it to the `‚ú® Master Initiatives` database.
    *   Toggle "Show on `‚ú® Master Initiatives`" and name the back-link `Related Documents`.

## Phase 3: Build Dashboards and Pages

This phase focuses on creating the user-facing dashboards that provide filtered views into the master databases.

**Task 3.1: Create Initiative Dashboard Pages** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Create three new pages: `Framework Initiative`, `Copilot Initiative`, and `Domain-Specific Initiative`.
*   **Details:** These can be created at the top level of the workspace for now.

**Task 3.2: Build the `Framework Initiative` Dashboard** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** On the `Framework Initiative` page, add the following views:
    *   A linked view of the `‚ú® Master Initiatives` DB, filtered where `Type` is "Framework".
    *   A linked view of the `üî© Framework Projects` DB.
    *   A linked view of the `üìö Document Hub` DB, filtered to show documents related to Framework initiatives.

---

## Phase 4: Initial Content Migration

This phase involves populating the new structure with existing data.

**Task 4.1: Migrate Documents** `[COMPLETED]`
*   **Action:** Move all pages from the old "Document Hub" into the new `üìö Document Hub` database.
*   **Details:** As each document is moved, assign it the correct `Category`.

---

## Phase 5: Layering Integrations (Iterative)

This phase will be done iteratively after the core structure is stable.

**Task 5.1: Set up Jira Integration**
*   **Action:** On the `Framework Initiative` page, embed a live view of the Framework Jira board.
*   **Action:** On the `Copilot Initiative` page, embed a live view of the Copilot Jira board.

**Task 5.2: Set up GitHub Integration**
*   **Action:** When a PR is created for a project in the `Framework Projects` DB, paste the link into the `Related PRs` property and into the body of the project's page to create a synced block.

**Task 5.3: Set up Slack Integration**
*   **Action:** Configure a Slack notification for the `#announcements` channel when a new page with the `Category` "Announcement" is added to the `Document Hub`.
