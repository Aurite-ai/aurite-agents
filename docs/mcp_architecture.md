# MCP Architecture for Agent Routing

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for implementing MCP (Model Context Protocol) in our agent routing system. The implementation will serve as a host that manages multiple MCP clients to connect our agents with various tool servers.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Routing Host

- Acts as the primary MCP host application
- Manages the lifecycle of MCP clients
- Routes agent requests to appropriate tool servers
- Handles client-server connection management
- Implements security and access control

### 2. MCP Client Manager

- Creates and maintains MCP client instances
- Handles client initialization and connection
- Manages client state and capabilities
- Implements client-side protocol handling
- Provides client discovery and selection

### 3. Tool Server Integration

- Manages connections to MCP tool servers
- Handles server capability discovery
- Implements server health monitoring
- Provides server selection logic
- Manages server connection pools

### 4. Message Router

- Routes agent requests to appropriate clients
- Handles message transformation and validation
- Implements request/response tracking
- Manages notification routing
- Provides error handling and recovery

## Communication Flow

### 1. Initialization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Host
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Agent->>Host: Request Tool Access
    Host->>Client: Create Client
    Client->>Server: Initialize Connection
    Server->>Client: Capability Response
    Client->>Host: Ready Status
    Host->>Agent: Tool Available
```

### 2. Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Host
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Agent->>Host: Tool Request
    Host->>Client: Route Request
    Client->>Server: MCP Request
    Server->>Client: MCP Response
    Client->>Host: Process Response
    Host->>Agent: Tool Result
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Protocol Layer

- Implements MCP message types:

  ```typescript
  interface AgentToolRequest {
    toolId: string;
    method: string;
    params: unknown;
  }

  interface ToolResponse {
    result: unknown;
    error?: {
      code: number;
      message: string;
    };
  }
  ```

### 2. Transport Layer

- Primary use of local transports for tool servers
- Support for remote transports when needed
- Transport selection based on server location

### 3. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error mapping between:
  - Agent errors
  - MCP protocol errors
  - Tool server errors
- Recovery strategies for common failures
- Graceful degradation of services

## Security Model

### 1. Access Control

- Tool server authentication
- Agent authorization for tools
- Capability-based security model

### 2. Data Protection

- Secure message handling
- Sensitive data management
- Resource access controls

### 3. Monitoring

- Connection monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring
