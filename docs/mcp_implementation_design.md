# MCP Implementation Design

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Aurite Agent Orchestrator will serve as the standardized interface for connecting our AI agents with various tools and data sources. This document outlines our approach to implementing MCP's client-server architecture within our system.

## Architecture Components

### 1. MCP Host (Aurite Agent Orchestrator)

- Acts as the primary host application managing agent interactions
- Maintains connections to multiple MCP servers
- Handles agent request routing and response aggregation
- Implements security policies and access control

### 2. MCP Clients

- Implements 1:1 connections with MCP servers
- Handles protocol-level communication
- Manages connection lifecycle and error handling
- Implements retry and fallback mechanisms

### 3. MCP Servers

Each server will be specialized for specific capabilities:

#### Core Servers

- **File System Server**

  - Access to workspace files and directories
  - File content reading and manipulation
  - Directory operations and navigation

- **Tool Registry Server**

  - Tool discovery and registration
  - Version management for tool implementations
  - Tool metadata and capability descriptions

- **Prompt Management Server**
  - MDC document storage and retrieval
  - Context-aware prompt selection
  - Prompt versioning and A/B testing

#### Integration Servers

- **Database Access Server**

  - Secure database connections
  - Query execution and result formatting
  - Schema introspection

- **API Integration Server**
  - External API connections
  - Authentication management
  - Rate limiting and quota tracking

## Implementation Details

### Server Development

1. **Base Server Framework**

```python
class MCPServer:
    async def initialize(self):
        # Server startup and resource initialization

    async def handle_connection(self, client):
        # Client connection handling

    async def process_request(self, request):
        # Request processing and routing
```

2. **Resource Management**

- Resource discovery and registration
- Access control and permissions
- Resource versioning and updates

3. **Tool Implementation**

- Standard tool interface definition
- Tool registration and discovery
- Input validation and error handling

### Client Development

1. **Connection Management**

```python
class MCPClient:
    async def connect(self, server_url):
        # Establish server connection

    async def request(self, resource, params):
        # Make requests to server

    async def handle_response(self, response):
        # Process server responses
```

2. **Protocol Handling**

- Request/response formatting
- Error handling and recovery
- Connection pooling and management

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**

- Client authentication mechanisms
- Server-to-server authentication
- Token management and rotation

2. **Authorization**

- Resource-level access control
- Tool usage permissions
- Rate limiting and quotas

3. **Data Protection**

- Encryption in transit
- Secure credential storage
- Audit logging

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- [ ] Implement base MCP server framework
- [ ] Develop client connection handling
- [ ] Set up basic authentication

### Phase 2: Resource Implementation

- [ ] Implement file system resources
- [ ] Create tool registry system
- [ ] Develop prompt management integration

### Phase 3: Integration Development

- [ ] Build database access server
- [ ] Implement API integration server
- [ ] Create monitoring and logging

### Phase 4: Security & Testing

- [ ] Implement comprehensive security measures
- [ ] Develop integration tests
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**

- Server component testing
- Client library testing
- Resource implementation testing

2. **Integration Tests**

- End-to-end connection testing
- Multi-server interaction testing
- Error handling and recovery testing

3. **Security Tests**

- Authentication testing
- Authorization validation
- Penetration testing

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics Collection**

- Connection statistics
- Request/response timing
- Resource usage tracking

2. **Logging**

- Detailed operation logs
- Error and warning tracking
- Audit trail maintenance

3. **Alerting**

- Error rate monitoring
- Performance degradation alerts
- Security incident detection

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of base server framework
2. Develop core client library
3. Create first resource implementations
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Implement security measures

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle server discovery in a distributed environment?
2. What's the optimal strategy for connection pooling and management?
3. How should we implement versioning for tools and resources?
4. What metrics are most important for monitoring MCP server health?
