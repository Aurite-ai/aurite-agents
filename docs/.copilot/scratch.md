Hello Gemini. The repository we are currently in is the AI Agent Development Framework that I built myself for my company (Aurite is the company name).

I have recently finished the first foundational version of the framework, and I need test users to determine the direction that I should take this framework as I continue developing it.

To aid in this testing work, my project manager and boss Paul has recently connected me with a USC University professor (named Bruce) who teaches data analytics to Masters students.

Bruce has agreed to having 10 groups (3 students in each group) use my framework to build simple data analytic agents that will solve real business goals (very simple real business goals). They will likely use Jupyter through a Jupyter MCP tool server, but I am getting ahead of myself because most of these students have not heard of an Agent (or MCP), and the students do not have business experience (their academic background is not geared towards the application of software development, like building and deploying web apps).

In order to teach the students how to use my framework so they can create their data analytic agents, I plan to create 3 conceptual documents and 3 tutorials to guide new users through the different methods (mainly json configuration work) for creating an agent in my framework.


Hello Gemini. I need your assistance merging some branches in my company's AI agent development framework repository. For context on what we are merging: about 2 weeks ago I created a packaged version of the framework so that users can run `pip install aurite` and then run `aurite init` to scaffold the files and folders for the framework (the only required file is the aurite_config.json file, or a PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH env variable pointing to a valid project json configuration file within the project root).

I then went on vacation for 2 weeks, so I decided not to merge the packaged version changes (in the 'packaging' branch). Over the past 2 weeks, my coworker Blake has made a few changes (mainly adding new features that shouldn't cause conflicts). He has 2 PRs that I need to merge. These PRs are based on the main branch that does not have the packaging changes merged.

The reason I want your assistance here is because I made some changes that may cause issues with the git merge due to the nature of the changes. I moved all the files/folders in src/ to src/aurite/ so that users can import with from aurite import.. and I am worried this may confuse git. I also renamed the
