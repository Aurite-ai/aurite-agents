!!! info How to use these tutorials
    Start with the interactive notebooks for hands-on learning, then move to local project guides as you gain confidence.

## Part 1: Learning with Notebooks

This module provides a hands-on, code-first approach to learning Aurite through a series of interactive Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

1.  **Notebook 1: Introducing Aurite Agents**

    - Get started with the basics of the framework.

## Part 2: Building Local Projects

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!! tip Recommended IDE
    VSCode is suggested for local development, but any Python IDE will work.

Once you are comfortable with the concepts from the notebooks, these tutorials guide you through setting up and running the Aurite framework in a local development environment like VSCode.

6.  **Building Your Own MCP Server**

    - Learn how to extend Aurite by creating a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides new tools for your agents.
    - Step-by-step instructions for building, testing, and integrating your own MCP server.
    - [Tutorial: Building Your Own MCP Server](06_Building_Your_Own_MCP_Server.md)

7.  **Understanding Aurite Projects**

    - This tutorial walks you through the structure of a local Aurite project and how to configure and run an agent by editing configuration files.
