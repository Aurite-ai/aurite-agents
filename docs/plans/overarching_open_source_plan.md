# Implementation Plan: Open Source Preparation for Aurite Agents

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-13
**Author(s):** Ryan, Gemini
**Related Design Document (Optional):** N/A

## 1. Goals
*   Prepare the `aurite-agents` framework for open-sourcing by completing a series of refactoring, documentation, security, efficiency, packaging, and final review tasks.
*   Ensure the framework is robust, well-documented, secure, and accessible for community use and contribution.

## 2. Scope
*   **In Scope:**
    *   Task A: Layer 1 Refactoring, Testing, Documentation & README Update.
    *   Task B: Framework-wide Security & Efficiency Check.
    *   Task C: Dockerfile Verification.
    *   Task D: Packaging Strategy Definition (addressing file pathing).
    *   Task E: Final Open Source Readiness Checks (LICENSE, etc.).
    *   Creation of detailed sub-plans for each of the above tasks.
*   **Out of Scope (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   The actual act of publishing the framework to open source repositories (e.g., GitHub, PyPI).
    *   Marketing or community engagement activities post-open sourcing.
    *   Development of new features not directly related to open source preparation.

## 3. Prerequisites (Optional)
*   N/A for this overarching plan. Prerequisites will be defined in sub-plans.

## 4. Overarching Tasks (Phases)

*   (Each task below will involve creating a detailed sub-Implementation Plan before execution.)

**Task A: Layer 1 Finalization & Root README Update**
*   **Objective:** Complete refactoring, testing, and documentation for Layer 1 (API/Entrypoints). Update the root `README.md` to serve as a central hub for all layer documentation.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Refactor Layer 1 code for clarity and maintainability.
    *   Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for Layer 1 components.
    *   Update/create documentation for Layer 1 (e.g., `docs/layers/1_entrypoints.md`).
    *   Restructure the root `README.md` to include an overview and links to individual layer documents in `docs/layers/`.
*   **Verification:** Completion of a detailed sub-plan for Task A, all Layer 1 tests passing, updated documentation, and a revised `README.md` approved by Ryan.

**Task B: Framework Security & Efficiency Review**
*   **Objective:** Conduct a thorough review of the entire `aurite-agents` framework to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities and efficiency bottlenecks.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Analyze code for common security issues (e.g., input validation, dependency vulnerabilities, sensitive data handling).
    *   Profile performance-critical sections of the framework.
    *   Implement necessary changes to enhance security and optimize performance.
    *   Document findings and changes.
*   **Verification:** Completion of a detailed sub-plan for Task B, implementation of agreed-upon security/efficiency improvements, and review by Ryan.

**Task C: Dockerfile Verification**
*   **Objective:** Ensure the project's Dockerfile is up-to-date, functional, and allows for successful building and running of the framework in a containerized environment.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Review the existing `Dockerfile`.
    *   Build a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
    *   Run the container and perform basic functionality tests.
    *   Update the `Dockerfile` and related documentation if necessary.
*   **Verification:** Completion of a detailed sub-plan for Task C, successful Docker image build and container run, and basic operational tests passing within the container, approved by Ryan.

**Task D: Packaging & Distribution Strategy**
*   **Objective:** Determine the optimal strategy for packaging and distributing the `aurite-agents` framework as an open-source project, with a focus on creating a pip-installable Python package. Address known file pathing challenges.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Investigate solutions for managing dynamic file paths for:
        1.  MCP servers using STDIO.
        2.  Configuration files (`config/`).
        3.  User-created custom workflows.
    *   Design the package structure (`setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for Poetry/Flit).
    *   Outline steps for building and publishing the package.
    *   Document the chosen packaging strategy and usage instructions.
*   **Verification:** Completion of a detailed sub-plan for Task D, a documented and agreed-upon packaging strategy that addresses file pathing issues, approved by Ryan.

**Task E: Final Open Source Readiness Review**
*   **Objective:** Conduct a final comprehensive review of the framework and all supporting materials to ensure readiness for public release.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Create/select an appropriate open source LICENSE file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
    *   Review all documentation (READMEs, layer docs, contribution guidelines if any) for completeness and clarity.
    *   Ensure all tests are passing and code quality meets open source standards.
    *   Prepare a checklist of final items before public release.
*   **Verification:** Completion of a detailed sub-plan for Task E, all checklist items addressed, LICENSE file in place, and final approval from Ryan.

## 5. Testing Strategy
*   Each of the overarching tasks (A-E) will have its own detailed testing strategy defined within its respective sub-Implementation Plan. This will include unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests as appropriate for the specific task.

## 6. Potential Risks & Mitigation (Optional)
*   **Risk:** Underestimation of effort for sub-tasks, particularly packaging (Task D) due to file path complexities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Allocate sufficient time for research and iterative development in the sub-plan for Task D. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
*   **Risk:** Scope creep during any of the tasks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the defined scope in each sub-Implementation Plan. Defer unrelated improvements or features.

## 7. Open Questions & Discussion Points (Optional)
*   (To be populated as sub-plans are developed or if overarching questions arise).
