# Testing Architecture

## Overview

The Kahuna Testing & Security Framework implements a hierarchical, compositional testing architecture that mirrors the natural dependencies between AI components. This document describes the core architectural principles and design decisions.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Compositional Testing

Components are tested in layers, with each layer building upon the results of lower layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Workflow Testing            │ ← Business Logic Layer
│   (Inherits all component tests)    │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────┴──────────────────────┐
│          Agent Testing              │ ← Integration Layer
│    (Inherits LLM + MCP tests)       │
└──────┬───────────────────┬──────────┘
       │                   │
┌──────┴──────┐     ┌──────┴──────┐
│  LLM Tests  │     │ MCP Tests   │    ← Foundation Layer
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

### 2. Test Result Inheritance

Higher-level components automatically inherit relevant test results from their dependencies:

- **Agents** inherit security and quality scores from their LLMs and MCP servers
- **Workflows** inherit aggregated scores from all constituent agents
- **Redundant tests are skipped** when foundation components have already been validated

### 3. Separation of Concerns

The architecture maintains clear boundaries between:

- **Quality vs Security:** Different testing objectives and methodologies
- **Development vs Runtime:** Different execution contexts and constraints
- **Component vs Integration:** Different scopes of validation

## Testing Strategies

### Development-Time Testing

**Purpose:** Validate components before deployment

**Characteristics:**

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Longer execution times acceptable
- Focus on finding issues early
- Includes edge cases and stress testing

**Execution Model:**

```python
def development_test(component):
    # 1. Run all foundation tests
    foundation_results = test_foundations(component.dependencies)

    # 2. Run component-specific tests
    component_results = test_component(component)

    # 3. Run integration tests
    integration_results = test_integration(component, foundation_results)

    # 4. Aggregate and report
    return aggregate_results(foundation_results, component_results, integration_results)
```

### Runtime Testing

**Purpose:** Monitor and validate in production

**Characteristics:**

- Selective, critical tests only
- Minimal performance impact
- Real-time threat detection
- Continuous quality monitoring

**Execution Model:**

```python
def runtime_monitor(component, request):
    # 1. Quick security checks
    security_check = quick_security_scan(request)
    if not security_check.passed:
        return block_request(security_check)

    # 2. Quality monitoring (async)
    async_quality_monitor(component, request)

    # 3. Allow execution with monitoring
    return execute_with_monitoring(component, request)
```

## Test Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Bottom-Up (Development)

```
1. Test all LLMs
2. Test all MCP Servers
3. Test Agents (using LLM/MCP results)
4. Test Workflows (using Agent results)
```

**Use Case:** Initial development, comprehensive validation

### Pattern 2: Top-Down (Debugging)

```
1. Workflow fails
2. Identify failing agent(s)
3. Check agent's LLM and MCP components
4. Isolate root cause
```

**Use Case:** Production issues, troubleshooting

### Pattern 3: Parallel with Dependencies

```
         ┌─→ LLM Tests ─┐
Start ─┤                ├─→ Agent Tests ─→ Workflow Tests
         └─→ MCP Tests ─┘
```

**Use Case:** Efficient testing with dependency management

## Failure Handling

### Failure Propagation Rules

1. **Foundation Failure → Component Blocked**

   - If LLM fails security, all agents using it are blocked
   - If MCP server fails quality, agents get degraded scores

2. **Partial Failure → Degraded Operation**

   - Non-critical test failures allow operation with warnings
   - Critical failures block execution entirely

3. **Cascade Prevention**
   - Early termination when foundation tests fail
   - Skip dependent tests to save resources

### Failure Impact Analysis

```
Component Failure Impact:
├── Direct Impact
│   └── Component cannot be deployed/used
├── Upstream Impact
│   └── Dependent components marked as "at risk"
└── Business Impact
    └── Affected workflows and business processes identified
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Test Result Caching

- Cache test results with TTL based on component stability
- Reuse results across multiple test runs
- Invalidate cache on component updates

### Distributed Testing

- Parallelize independent tests across workers
- Use message queues for test coordination
- Aggregate results in central database

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading of test dependencies
- Incremental testing for small changes
- Test prioritization based on risk assessment

## Integration Points

- Business workflow definitions
- Component requirements
- Quality thresholds
- Security policies

**Processing:**

- Map business requirements to technical tests
- Generate test plans from workflow definitions

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

```
Layer 1: Input Validation (MCP Servers)
Layer 2: Content Filtering (LLMs)
Layer 3: Action Authorization (Agents)
Layer 4: Workflow Policies (Workflows)
```

### Zero Trust Principles

- Verify at every layer
- No implicit trust between components
- Continuous validation in runtime

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **AI-Powered Test Generation**

   - Automatically generate tests from requirements
   - Learn from historical test results

2. **Predictive Failure Analysis**

   - Predict likely failure points
   - Proactive testing recommendations

3. **Adaptive Testing**
   - Adjust test intensity based on component stability
   - Dynamic test selection based on risk

### Extension Points

- Webhook integration for external tools
- API for third-party test frameworks
