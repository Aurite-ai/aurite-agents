The partly cloudy skies and low in the mid 50s will make for cool weather, especially with the 10-20 mph winds. Wearing pants and long sleeves will help keep you warm. A light to medium weight jacket is recommended, especially if you'll be outside for extended periods. Closed toe shoes are best to keep your feet warm. A light scarf is optional but can provide extra warmth if needed. Dressing in layers will allow you to adjust to changing temperatures throughout the day.
