Recommended Outfit for San Francisco Weather:

With a temperature of 18°C (64°F) and partly cloudy skies, you'll want to dress in layers. 

Top: Wear a light long-sleeve shirt or blouse. Bring a light sweater or jacket to put on if it gets cooler, especially once the sun goes down.

Bottom: Pants, jeans, or a long skirt will keep your legs comfortable. It's not quite warm enough for shorts. 

Shoes: Closed-toe shoes like sneakers or loafers are a good choice. Sandals are probably too cool for this weather.

Accessories: Bring sunglasses since there will be some sun. A light scarf can help cut the wind and add some warmth if needed.

The key is light, breathable layers that you can easily add or remove to adapt to temperature changes throughout the day. An outfit like this will keep you comfortable while exploring San Francisco in this pleasant partly cloudy weather.
