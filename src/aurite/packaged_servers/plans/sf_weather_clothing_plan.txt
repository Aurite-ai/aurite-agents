With a temperature of 18°C (64°F) and foggy conditions in San Francisco, I recommend wearing the following:

- Long pants or jeans 
- A light sweater or long sleeve shirt
- A light jacket or coat, preferably water resistant due to the fog
- Closed toe shoes like sneakers or boots
- You may want to bring a scarf and light gloves in case it feels chilly

The high humidity at 85% can make it feel a bit cooler than the actual temperature. Dressing in layers will allow you to adjust based on your comfort level. Avoid sandals or shorts since it is on the cooler side and foggy. A hooded jacket or carrying an umbrella is also a good idea in case the fog turns to mist or light rain.
