The moderate temperature and high humidity combined with fog means you'll want to dress in layers. Pants and a long sleeve top will be comfortable, with a light jacket or coat to cut the chill and dampness from the fog. Closed-toe shoes are recommended to keep feet dry if walking in foggy conditions. A light scarf can provide extra warmth if needed. The key is having multiple light, breathable layers to adapt to the cool, damp weather.
