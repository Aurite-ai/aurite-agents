San Francisco Weather Clothing Plan

Weather Conditions:
- Temperature: 18Â°C
- Conditions: Foggy 
- Humidity: 85%

Recommended Clothing:
- Long pants
- Long sleeve shirt or light sweater

- Closed-toe shoes

The mild temperature and high humidity combined with fog means dressing in layers is recommended. Long sleeves and pants will keep you warm enough without overheating. A light coat or jacket that is easy to remove is ideal. Closed-toe shoes will keep feet dry if the fog turns to mist or light rain. A light scarf can help keep your neck warm in the damp air.
