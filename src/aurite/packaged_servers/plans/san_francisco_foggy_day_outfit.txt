The key is to dress in layers that you can easily add or remove as temperatures change throughout the day. Opt for fabrics that wick moisture and insulate well in damp, cool conditions. A waterproof outer layer is essential to stay dry. Expect reduced visibility in the fog, so bright or reflective clothing is recommended if you'll be walking or biking.
