Dress in layers with a light jacket, long sleeves, and long pants. Closed toe shoes are best for the potential dampness. A light scarf can help with the chill. And keep a compact umbrella handy in case the fog becomes misty. Overall, aim for light layered clothing that you can easily add or remove to stay comfortable in the cool, damp weather.
