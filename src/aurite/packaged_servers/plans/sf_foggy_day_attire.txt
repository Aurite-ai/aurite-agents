Recommended Attire:
With the cool temperatures and foggy conditions, dress in layers. Wear long pants and closed-toe shoes. A light jacket or coat is recommended, preferably something water resistant in case the fog turns to drizzle. A scarf and light gloves may provide extra warmth and comfort in the damp, cool air. 

Since it will likely remain overcast, sunglasses are optional. Have an umbrella handy in case the fog becomes heavier mist or light rain. Avoid sandals or open-toe shoes due to the damp conditions.

Overall, prioritize warmth and water-resistance in your clothing choices to stay comfortable in the brisk, foggy San Francisco weather. Layers will allow you to easily adapt to changing temperatures throughout the day.
