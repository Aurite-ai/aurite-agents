Based on the current weather in London (15°C, rainy, 90% humidity), I recommend wearing the following:

- A waterproof jacket or coat with a hood
- Waterproof shoes or boots 
- An umbrella for extra protection from the rain
- Long pants rather than shorts or a skirt
- A light sweater or long-sleeved shirt for the mild 15°C temperature
- Avoid fabrics like cotton that absorb water and take a long time to dry
