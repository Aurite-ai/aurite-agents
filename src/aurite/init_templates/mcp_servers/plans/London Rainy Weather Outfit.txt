Given the weather conditions in London:
- Temperature: 15°C
- Conditions: Rainy
- Humidity: 90%

Here is the recommended outfit:

- Waterproof jacket or rain coat
- Warm sweater or light jacket underneath
- Closed-toe shoes or boots (preferably waterproof)
- Umbrella or rain hat
- Scarf or gloves if it feels particularly chilly

The key is to dress in layers to stay warm and dry. The rainy conditions mean you'll want to have waterproof outerwear to protect against the rain. And the cool 15°C temperature calls for some insulation, like a sweater or light jacket, under your rain coat. Closed-toe shoes or boots will help keep your feet dry as well.

An umbrella or rain hat is also a good idea to keep the rain off your head and face. And a scarf or gloves can provide an extra layer of warmth if needed.

Overall, the goal is to stay comfortable and dry despite the rainy weather in London today.
