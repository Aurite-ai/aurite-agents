Given the current weather conditions in San Francisco:

- Temperature: 18°C (64°F)
- Conditions: Foggy
- Humidity: 85%

Here is the recommended outfit:

- Light jacket or sweater - The temperature is cool, so you'll want something to keep you warm, but not too heavy.
- Long pants - With the fog and cooler temperatures, long pants will help protect you from the chill.
- Closed-toe shoes - The damp conditions mean you'll want shoes that can handle a bit of moisture.
- Umbrella or light rain jacket - Bring something to protect you from the fog and potential light rain.

The key is to dress in layers so you can adjust as needed throughout the day. The foggy, humid conditions mean you'll want to be prepared for a mix of cool temperatures and potential precipitation.
