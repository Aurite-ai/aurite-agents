Tests for the evaluation workflow using the test_mcp_host fixture.

This module tests the EvaluationWorkflow implementation to verify:
1. Workflow initialization with the JSON-configured host
2. Workflow registration with the host system
3. Agent evaluation using the proper MCP tools
4. End-to-end workflow execution through the host's workflow manager

1. Revenue increased by 15% year-over-year, reaching $2.4 million
2. Customer acquisition cost decreased from $52 to $48
3. Retention rate improved from 68% to 72%

The main growth drivers were:
- New product line expansion (+22% revenue impact)
- Improved marketing efficiency (+8% conversion rate)
- Price optimization strategy (+5% margin improvement)

Recommendations:
1. Continue investing in product expansion
2. Allocate more resources to high-converting marketing channels
3. Consider further price optimization in underperforming segments
4. Improve onboarding to boost retention further

Let me know if you need more specific analysis on any of these areas."""
