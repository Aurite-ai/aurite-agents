Hello Assistant,

We are ready to begin the next phase of the **[Brief Overall Project/Feature Name, e.g., MCP Host Overhaul]**.
The overarching plan remains documented in: **[Path to Overarching Plan Doc, e.g., @/aurite-mcp/docs/plans/overarching_host_refactor_plan.md]**. (Please ignore similarly named plans in the `/completed` subdirectories).

We have just successfully completed **[Phase Name/Number Just Completed, e.g., Phase 1: Host Cleanup & Simplification]**. The implementation details for that are in: **[Path to Completed Phase Plan Doc, e.g., @/aurite-mcp/docs/plans/phase1_implementation_plan.md]**.

**Action:** Please review these two documents (`[Overarching Plan Doc]` and `[Completed Phase Plan Doc]`) to refresh context on our progress and the overall goals.

**Current Task: Initiate New Phase Planning**

We are now entering the **Planning & Design Phase** for:
**[New Phase Name/Number, e.g., Phase 2: MCP Server Management Enhancements]**

The primary goal of this phase is: **[Brief Goal of New Phase, e.g., to enhance how MCP servers are managed by the host, specifically adding component exclusion capabilities]**.

**Action:** To prepare the implementation plan for this phase, let's start by reviewing the relevant files to understand the current implementation and determine the optimal approach:
*   **[Path to Relevant File 1, e.g., @/aurite-mcp/src/host/models.py]**
*   **[Path to Relevant File 2, e.g., @/aurite-mcp/src/host/host.py]**
*   **[Add other relevant files/directories as needed]**

**Initial Focus for Planning:**
For the *first part* of the implementation plan, let's define the steps for: **[Describe the very first feature/change for this new phase, e.g., Adding an `exclude: list[str]` field to the `ClientConfig` model in `models.py` and implementing the filtering logic in `host.py` to ignore components matching the exclude list (e.g., prompts, resources, tools like `save_plan`)]**.

**Deliverable:**
The output of this planning activity will be the implementation plan document located at: **[Path for New Implementation Plan Doc, e.g., @/aurite-mcp/docs/plans/phase2_implementation_plan.md]**.

**Reminder:** As per our workflow, focus on creating a plan that is simple, readable, meaningful, and achieves the goal with the minimal necessary changes.

**Next Step:** Please confirm you've reviewed the context documents and share your initial thoughts on reviewing `[Relevant File 1]` and `[Relevant File 2]` to plan for the `[Specific initial feature/change]`. Let's outline the steps for the new implementation plan.
