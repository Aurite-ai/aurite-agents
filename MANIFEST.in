recursive-include src *.pyi # For type stubs if any
include src/aurite_agents/py.typed # For PEP 561 compliance if src/aurite_agents is the package dir

# If your package directory is just 'aurite_agents' directly under 'src/'
# and 'src' itself is not part of the package name installed in site-packages,
# then py.typed should be in 'src/aurite_agents/py.typed'.
# The [tool.setuptools.packages.find] where = ["."] include = ["src*"]
# suggests that 'src' is part of the structure found, and 'aurite_agents' would be inside 'src'.
# So, if the actual package installed is 'aurite_agents', then 'src/aurite_agents/py.typed' is correct.
# If the package installed is 'src.aurite_agents', then 'src/py.typed' might be what you'd aim for,
# but that's less common. Given the include = ["src*"], it's likely setuptools correctly
# identifies 'src/aurite_agents' as the package 'aurite_agents'.
