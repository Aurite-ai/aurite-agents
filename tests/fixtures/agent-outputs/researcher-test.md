Based on the synthesis of the most recent predictions and analysis from multiple experts, my conclusion is as follows:

• Judy Battista (NFL.com) predicts a narrow Chiefs win (28–24), noting that while the Eagles are balanced, the Chiefs have a championship pedigree and the ability to win close games.
• Fox Sports’ analysis similarly leans toward the Chiefs (27–24) on the strength of their roster and their experience in high-pressure scenarios.
• Meanwhile, although CBS Sports gives the edge to the Eagles (31–24), the overall betting odds from BetMGM show Kansas City slightly favored (spread: Chiefs –1.5; moneyline: Chiefs –120 vs. Eagles +100).

Taking into account these varied expert analyses and the slight betting market edge, I lean toward the Kansas City Chiefs as the likely 2025 Super Bowl winners, potentially making history with their third consecutive title.

Thus, my prediction is that the Kansas City Chiefs will win the 2025 Super Bowl.
