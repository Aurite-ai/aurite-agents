      "message": "Below is a detailed, step-by-step plan designed for agents to research, verify, and compile the story of who won the 2025 Super Bowl as well as the key game details, moments, and strategic factors leading to the victory.\n\n────────────────────────\n1. Define Objectives and Scope\n────────────────────────\n• Objective: Identify the winning team of the 2025 Super Bowl and extract comprehensive details including the score, game overview, key moments (turning points such as critical plays, injuries, or controversial calls), and the tactical strategies (both offensive and defensive) that determined the outcome.\n• Scope: Cover pre-game build-up, in-game events, post-game commentary, and include insights from expert analyses. Consider sources like official team reports, interviews, and referee decisions.\n\n────────────────────────\n2. Establish Research Channels and Sources\n────────────────────────\n• Official Sources:\n  - NFL.com and the official Super Bowl website for game recaps, official statistics, and press releases.\n  - Team websites and social media accounts for insider details or quotes.\n• Media Outlets:\n  - Major sports networks (ESPN, Fox Sports, CBS Sports) for in-depth game analysis and highlight reels.\n  - Reputable newspapers and sports magazines for written post-game analysis and opinion pieces.\n• Secondary Sources:\n  - Fan websites, podcasts, and social media discussions (Twitter, Reddit) for real-time reactions and to identify possible overlooked key moments.\n  - Archived video footage for visual verification of game-changing plays.\n• Expert Analysis:\n  - Interviews or op-eds by recognized football analysts, former players, or coaches discussing the game’s strategies.\n\n────────────────────────\n3. Develop a Step-by-Step Data Collection Process\n────────────────────────\nA. Preliminary Data Collection:\n   1. Search for an official recap of the 2025 Super Bowl on the NFL and Super Bowl websites.\n   2. Collect the final score and basic game statistics (yards gained, turnovers, time of possession, etc.).\n\nB. Detailed Game Analysis:\n   1. Identify a list of key moments:\n      - Identify major scoring plays, contested catches, turnovers, or game-altering penalties.\n      - Note any injuries or controversial referee decisions that impacted the game.\n   2. Gather game footage and highlight reels to visually confirm and select candidate moments.\n   3. Document defensive and offensive strategies employed by both teams, including formations, key adjustments, and game-time decisions.\n   4. Retrieve quotes and commentary related to these moments from interviews with coaches, players, and analysts.\n\nC. Contextual and Pre/Post Game Analysis:\n   1. Investigate the pre-game expectations and strategies described by both teams.\n   2. Review post-game interviews, conferences, and media articles that discuss how the game evolved.\n   3. Look at historical comparisons if mentioned to gauge the significance of the Super Bowl performance relative to expectations.\n\nD. Cross-Verification:\n   1. Compare details across multiple sources to confirm accuracy.\n   2. Note any discrepancies and, if found, prioritize sources based on credibility (e.g., official vs. fan-sourced).\n   3. Use sports statistics databases (e.g., Pro-Football-Reference) to verify statistical claims.\n\n────────────────────────\n4. Organize the Data into a Clear Narrative\n────────────────────────\n• Structuring the Narrative:\n  - Introduction: State the winning team, final score, and overall atmosphere of the game's significance.\n  - Game Overview: Summarize the flow of the game, including critical sessions in each half.\n  - Key Moments: Provide a chronologically ordered list of turning points with vivid descriptions including quotes and visuals (if applicable).\n  - Strategic Analysis: Break down the strategies employed by both the winning and losing teams. Explain offensive drives, defensive schemes, and any mid-game adjustments.\n  - Expert Commentary: Incorporate insights from analysts to provide context and deeper understanding.\n  - Conclusion: Summarize how the key moments and strategies collectively led to the victory and reflect on any broader implications for the teams involved.\n\n────────────────────────\n5. Delegate Tasks Among Agents\n────────────────────────\n• Agent 1: Data Collector\n  - Task: Retrieve official game reports, statistics, and press releases from NFL.com, team websites, and social media.\n  - Deliverable: Raw data sets and official recaps.\n\n• Agent 2: Media Analyst\n  - Task: Compile and review articles, video highlights, and expert commentary from sports networks and reputable publications.\n  - Deliverable: A curated set of articles, video links, and transcribed expert opinion segments.\n\n• Agent 3: Verification Specialist\n  - Task: Cross-check the data collected (scores, key moments, and strategies) among various sources.\n  - Deliverable: A verification report noting any discrepancies and confirming the final details.\n\n• Agent 4: Narrative Developer/Writer\n  - Task: Synthesize the verified data into a coherent and detailed narrative covering the entire game flow.\n  - Deliverable: A complete written draft of the game summary with sub-sections (introduction, key moments, strategies, conclusions).\n\n────────────────────────\n6. Review, Consolidation, and Final Output\n────────────────────────\n• Collate all contributions from the agents.\n• Organize a review meeting/round to ensure consistency in terminology, style, and factual accuracy.\n• Finalize a comprehensive report or presentation that:\n   - Clearly identifies the winner and final score.\n   - Highlights the sequence of key moments and their relevance.\n   - Explains the strategic build-up that led to the win.\n   - Includes visual aids (charts, timeline graphics) if possible.\n• Prepare for updates or corrections by setting up a monitoring phase if any new information arises later.\n\n────────────────────────\n7. Documentation and Future Updates\n────────────────────────\n• Archive sources and materials for future reference.\n• Note potential follow-up items, such as extended interviews with involved parties or retrospective analyses during later sports seasons.\n• Create a plan for periodic validity checks with newly released retrospectives or historical analyses.\n\n────────────────────────\nBy following this comprehensive plan, agents will have a systematic approach enabling them to effectively determine the winner of the 2025 Super Bowl, detail the pivotal game moments, and unpack the strategic elements that led to the victory.",

See what you missed below, and see more of our reporting at apnews.com.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions for the second time in franchise history after beating the Kansas City Chiefs in New Orleans.\n\nHere’s what to know:\n\n\nHighlights: The Eagles dominated the two-time defending champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, right out the gate, leading 24-0 at halftime. Other plays included a 38-yard pick-6 by birthday boy Cooper DeJean, and a whole lot of pressure on Patrick Mahomes by Philadelphia’s pass rushers.\nThe halftime show: Kendrick Lamar showcased his greatest hits, including his Grammy-winning hit “Not Like Us,” with a performance featuring SZA. He also brought a surprise superstar and a bit of his hometown when Serena Williams appeared on the halftime stage.\nHigh-profile guests: President Donald Trump, who made history as the first president to attend the Super Bowl while in office, attended the game for the first half and left after the halftime performance. Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Megan Thee Stallion and Lady Gaga are among the big-name guests in the Superdome.\n\n8:49 PM PST\nHALFTIME SHOW\nHalftime disruptor is banned for life from NFL stadiums, events, league says\nBY JACK BROOK\nShare\n\nThe field cast member who disrupted the halftime show by displaying a flag will be banned from NFL stadiums and events for life, the league says.\n\n8:36 PM PST\nWill Travis Kelce retire?\nBY DAVE SKRETTA\nShare\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) walks off the field after the Philadelphia Eagles recovered a fumble by the Chiefs during the second half of the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game, Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nThe Chiefs wasted no time turning their attention to next season.\n\nWhether that will include Travis Kelce remains to be seen. The star tight end has been noncommittal about retirement, and Mahomes said he would give his good buddy the time and space necessary to make that decision.\n\n“He’s given so much to this team and to the NFL and been such a joy, not only for me to work with, but for people to watch. And so he knows he still has a lot of football left in him,” Mahomes said. “I know he still has love for the game, and he’ll get to spend some time with his family and make that decision on his own. But I mean, he knows he’ll come back here with welcome arms out. We love that guy.”\n\n8:35 PM PST\nHALFTIME SHOW\nHalftime show disruptor was part of field cast, NFL says\nBY JACK BROOK\nShare\n\nThe person who disrupted the halftime show by displaying a flag was part of the 400 member field cast, the NFL says.\n\n“The individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show,” the NFL said in a statement. “No one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.”\n\nRoc Nation, the entertainment company which produced the show, said the act “was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.”\n\n8:32 PM PST\nMahomes says he’ll learn from this loss: ‘You only get so few of these’\nBY DAVE SKRETTA\nShare\n\nMahomes said after the game the Eagles played great, he has to learn from this one, and all of it is going to motivate him.\n\n“Anytime you lose a Super Bowl and it’s the worst thing in the world, It’ll stick with you the rest of your career,” he said. “I mean these will be the two losses that will motivate me to be even better, for the rest of my career.”\n\n8:28 PM PST\nGAME ANALYSIS\nEagles defense dominates in franchise’s 2nd Super Bowl win\nBY DAN GELSTON\nShare\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles defensive back Cooper DeJean (33) runs into the end zone for a touchdown after intercepting a pass during the first half of the NFL Super Bowl 59 football game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nCooper DeJean took one to the house, Zack Baun made a pick in his old professional home and the Eagles defense so thoroughly thrashed Mahomes that by the time Kendrick Lamar had “Game Over” brightened in the Superdome stands to end his halftime set, it was just as clear, so too, was the Super Bowl.\n\nFrom Broad Street to Bourbon Street, the Eagles’ defense this season never failed 66-year-old defensive mastermind Vic Fangio. And the defense was never as great as it was in the Super Bowl.\n\n▶ Read more here\n\n8:21 PM PST\nHALFTIME SHOW\nSomeone was ‘detained by NFL security’ during halftime show, authorities tell AP\nBY JACK BROOK\nShare\n\nAn individual was “detained by NFL security on the field” during the halftime show, the New Orleans Police Department told The Associated Press in an emailed statement.\n\n“Law enforcement is working to determine applicable charges in this incident,” police said.\n\n8:19 PM PST\nGAME ANALYSIS\nEagles answer Mahomes magic with 6 sacks, 3 turnovers\nBY DAVE SKRETTA\nShare\n\nThere was a three-play sequence in the second quarter that not only summarized the way things went for Mahomes, but also the rest of the Chiefs.\n\nPhiladelphia had taken a 10-0 lead and the two-time defending champs were on the ropes when Mahomes was sacked by the Eagles’ Josh Sweat. On the next play, Sweat bottled him up again. And on the ensuing play, the two-time NFL MVP was under such duress that Mahomes threw an interception that Cooper DeJean returned 38 yards for a score.\n\nSix sacks. Three turnovers. And not an ounce of Mahomes magic.\n\nBy the time he was done dragging himself off the Superdome turf, and the Eagles were able to run the last seconds off the clock, Mahomes and the Chiefs were sent home with a humbling — humiliating, even — defeat.\n\n▶ Read more here\n\n8:12 PM PST\nGAME ANALYSIS\nHurts quiets any doubters with a Super Bowl MVP\nBY JOSH DUBOW\nShare\n\nHurts has often been judged by his failings more than his successes over the course of his career.\n\nGetting benched at halftime of a college football championship game.

Define Objectives and Scope\n────────────────────────\n• Objective: Identify the winning team of the 2025 Super Bowl and extract comprehensive details including the score, game overview, key moments (turning points such as critical plays, injuries, or controversial calls), and the tactical strategies (both offensive and defensive) that determined the outcome.\n• Scope: Cover pre-game build-up, in-game events, post-game commentary, and include insights from expert analyses. Consider sources like official team reports, interviews, and referee decisions.\n\n────────────────────────\n2. Establish Research Channels and Sources\n────────────────────────\n• Official Sources:\n  - NFL.com and the official Super Bowl website for game recaps, official statistics, and press releases.\n  - Team websites and social media accounts for insider details or quotes.\n• Media Outlets:\n  - Major sports networks (ESPN, Fox Sports, CBS Sports) for in-depth game analysis and highlight reels.\n  - Reputable newspapers and sports magazines for written post-game analysis and opinion pieces.\n• Secondary Sources:\n  - Fan websites, podcasts, and social media discussions (Twitter, Reddit) for real-time reactions and to identify possible overlooked key moments.\n  - Archived video footage for visual verification of game-changing plays.\n• Expert Analysis:\n  - Interviews or op-eds by recognized football analysts, former players, or coaches discussing the game’s strategies.\n\n────────────────────────\n3. Develop a Step-by-Step Data Collection Process\n────────────────────────\nA. Preliminary Data Collection:\n   1. Search for an official recap of the 2025 Super Bowl on the NFL and Super Bowl websites.\n   2. Collect the final score and basic game statistics (yards gained, turnovers, time of possession, etc.).\n\nB. Detailed Game Analysis:\n   1. Identify a list of key moments:\n      - Identify major scoring plays, contested catches, turnovers, or game-altering penalties.\n      - Note any injuries or controversial referee decisions that impacted the game.\n   2. Gather game footage and highlight reels to visually confirm and select candidate moments.\n   3. Document defensive and offensive strategies employed by both teams, including formations, key adjustments, and game-time decisions.\n   4. Retrieve quotes and commentary related to these moments from interviews with coaches, players, and analysts.\n\nC. Contextual and Pre/Post Game Analysis:\n   1. Investigate the pre-game expectations and strategies described by both teams.\n   2. Review post-game interviews, conferences, and media articles that discuss how the game evolved.\n   3. Look at historical comparisons if mentioned to gauge the significance of the Super Bowl performance relative to expectations.\n\nD. Cross-Verification:\n   1. Compare details across multiple sources to confirm accuracy.\n   2. Note any discrepancies and, if found, prioritize sources based on credibility (e.g., official vs. fan-sourced).\n   3.
