# Test Release Workflow 2

**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Test the updated release workflow with git synchronization fix

## Test Details

This file is created to test the automated release pipeline with the following improvements:

### Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ Git synchronization fix in release workflow
- ✅ Added `git fetch origin` and `git pull origin main --rebase` before version bump
- ✅ Prevents "failed to push some refs" errors

### Test Scenario
- **Branch:** `test-release-workflow-2`
- **Expected Labels:** `patch` + `test`
- **Expected Outcome:** TestPyPI publication with timestamped version
- **Workflow Chain:** Changelog Update → Release to PyPI

### Validation Points
1. Both workflows should run successfully
2. No git push conflicts should occur
3. Package should be published to TestPyPI
4. Version should include timestamp (e.g., `0.3.28rc20250829150800`)

This test validates the release automation system after implementing the git synchronization fix.
