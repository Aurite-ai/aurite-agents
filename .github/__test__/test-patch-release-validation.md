# Patch Test Release - September 4, 2025

Testing patch release workflow with current logic.

## Test Details
- **Date:** September 4, 2025, 1:12 AM
- **Branch:** test-patch-release-0904-0112
- **Purpose:** Validate patch release workflow for TestPyPI
- **Labels:** `patch` + `test`

## Expected Behavior (Current Logic)
- **Version Generated:** `0.3.28rc20250904011X` (current version + RC + timestamp)
- **TestPyPI Publication:** Package published with RC version
- **Workflow Chain:** PR merge → Changelog update → Release workflow → TestPyPI publish

## Workflow Validation Points
1. **PR Info Extraction:** Verify workflow extracts PR number from commit messages
2. **Label Detection:** Confirm workflow detects `patch` + `test` labels
3. **Version Generation:** Check RC version is created with timestamp
4. **TestPyPI Publication:** Validate package publishes without conflicts
5. **Changelog Update:** Ensure PR gets changelog entry

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Changelog updated with PR entry
- ✅ Release workflow detects `patch` + `test` labels
- ✅ Version `0.3.28rc20250904011X` created
- ✅ Package published to TestPyPI successfully
- ✅ No errors in workflow execution

## Notes
This test uses the current workflow logic where test releases use the current version (0.3.28) with RC suffix, regardless of the version type label. Future improvement will make patch test releases generate `0.3.29rc` versions.
