# Fixed Workflow Validation Test - September 2, 2025

This file tests the corrected automated release workflow with proper test version handling.

## Test Details
- **Date:** September 2, 2025
- **Purpose:** Validate fixed GitHub Actions release workflow
- **Fix Applied:** Test releases now properly set timestamp suffix in pyproject.toml
- **Expected Behavior:** 
  - Changelog should be updated automatically
  - TestPyPI release should be created with proper timestamp suffix (e.g., `0.3.28rc20250902141X`)
  - Version should be correctly set in pyproject.toml before building

## Previous Issue
The workflow was calculating the test version correctly but not updating pyproject.toml, causing Poetry to build with the base version (0.3.28) instead of the timestamped version.

## Fix Applied
Added `poetry version "$TEST_VERSION"` to update pyproject.toml with the calculated test version before building.

## Workflow Chain
1. PR merge with `patch` + `test` labels
2. Changelog update workflow runs
3. Release workflow triggers automatically
4. **NEW:** Test version is set in pyproject.toml with timestamp
5. Package built with correct timestamped version
6. Package published to TestPyPI

## Test Status
- [ ] PR created with proper labels (`patch` + `test`)
- [ ] Changelog workflow completed
- [ ] Release workflow completed with correct version
- [ ] TestPyPI publication verified with timestamp suffix
- [ ] No version conflicts on TestPyPI
